## Hello there !!!!! ğŸ‘‹

Avec l'entrianement d'IA et le machine learning vous devez garder a l'esprit :
"Il ne suffit pas de savoir cliquer sur 'train'. Il faut comprendre ce qu'on entraÃ®ne, comment on l'entraÃ®ne, et surtout pourquoi il faut l'amÃ©liorer."

With AI training and machine learning, you must always keep in mind::
"It is not enough to know how to click on 'train'. One must understand what is being trained, how it is being trained, and above all, why it needs to be improved."
